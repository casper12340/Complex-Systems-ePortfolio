Around day 800 something happens, after which the data is more spread out than in the beginning.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

ggplot(data=df_googl,aes(x=Date2,y=Open))+
  geom_segment(aes(xend=Date2,yend=Open+Open_diff),arrow=arrow(length=unit(.2,"cm")))+
  stat_density2d(aes(colour=..level..))+
    labs(
    title = "GOOGL Opening Stock - 2D Vector Density Plot",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Opening Price",
    colour = "Density Level"
  )
```

```{r}
## TEST DATA

Open_diff2 <- append(Open_diff, 0)
length(Open_diff2)

openLM <- lm(Open_diff2~Open, data=df_googl)
summary(openLM)
```

```{r}
plot(openLM)
